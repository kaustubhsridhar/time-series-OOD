# Efficient Out-of-Distribution Detection Using Latent Space of B-VAE for Cyber-Physical Systems

In this work we use a single B-Variational Autoencoder (B-VAE) to detect out-of-Distribution images and identify the most likely feature (e.g.,brightness, precipitation,etc.) that is responsible for the OOD. Typically, this is a multi-label anomaly detection problem which is solved using a chain of one-class classifiers. However, in this work we use a single efficient B-VAE detector that uses the principle of disentanglement to train the latent space to be sensitive to distribution shifts in different image features. 

We demonstrate our approach using an end-to-end driving Autonomous Vehicle in the CARLA simulation.

(a) **High Precipitation scene** where high precipitation is introduced into the scene. In this scene the detector martingale and the martingale of the precipitation reasoner increases when the high precipitation is introduced.

(b) **High Brightness scene** where the brightness is introduced into the scenes.  In this scene the detector martingale and the martingale of the brightness reasoner increases when the high precipitation is introduced.

# Setup

To run the CARLA setup with varied weather patterns and evaluate the B-VAE detector for OOD detection, clone this repo.

```
git clone https://github.com/scope-lab-vu/Beta-VAE-OOD-Detector.git
```
Then create a conda environment with python 3.7 and install the requirements as follows.

```
To run this setup first create a virtual environment with python 3.7
conda create -n bvae_env python=3.7
conda activate bvae_env
cd ${Beta-VAE-OOD-Monitor}  # Change ${Beta-VAE-OOD-Monitor} for your CARLA root folder
pip3 install -r requirements.txt

# New
conda install -c conda-forge scikit-learn
conda install -c conda-forge matplotlib 

# to solve some errors
pip install numpy==1.19.3 
```
You will also need to install CARLA 0.9.6. See [link](https://carla.org/2019/07/12/release-0.9.6/) for more instructions.

**Download** Training dataset and data for test scenes can be downloaded [here](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1IyHTLzYISViWN6EgU00b5P7-EC2LnqXY?usp=sharing)

# B-VAE detector Design and Deployment in CARLA simulation


1.  [data generation](https://github.com/scope-lab-vu/Beta-VAE-OOD-Detector/tree/main/data-generation) -- Generate CARLA scenes with varied weather parameters. 

2. [dave-II-dnn-training](https://github.com/scope-lab-vu/Beta-VAE-OOD-Detector/tree/main/lec-training) -- Train an NVIDIA DAVE-II LEC to steer the autonomous vehicle around Town1 of CARLA simulation. The LEC used here is based on [NVIDIA'S DAVE-II](https://arxiv-org.proxy.library.vanderbilt.edu/pdf/1604.07316.pdf?source=post_page---------------------------) DNN architecture.

2. [hyperparameter tuning](https://github.com/scope-lab-vu/Beta-VAE-OOD-Detector/tree/main/hyperparameter-tuning) -- Tune the B-VAE hyperparameters of Beta (B) and number of latent units (B). Three algorithms have been used in this work: Bayesian optimization, random search and grid search.

3. [bvae-train-test](https://github.com/scope-lab-vu/Beta-VAE-OOD-Detector/tree/main/bvae-train-test) -- Train the B-VAE with the selected hyperparameters (n,B) that was selected earlier.

3. [latent-unit-extraction](https://github.com/scope-lab-vu/Beta-VAE-OOD-Detector/tree/main/latent-unit-extraction) -- Extract and plot latent units using the selected B-VAE monitor. Then compare the latent variables across several scenes in a partition to select the detector latent variables (Ld) and reasoner latent variables (Lf)

4. [Carla-runtime](https://github.com/scope-lab-vu/Beta-VAE-OOD-Detector/tree/main/carla-runtime) -- Deploy the designed B-VAE detector in CARLA simulation to perform OOD detection.

# Extentions From the Earlier Work

1. Data generation -- Data generator using a Scenario Description Language (SDL) which uses random sampler to sample the CARLA weather parameters such as (sun, cloud, rain, illumination), and generate different scenes.

2. Bayesian Optimization Heuristic -- We perform Bayesian Optimization with [Mutual Information Gap](https://arxiv-org.proxy.library.vanderbilt.edu/pdf/1802.04942.pdf) as the optimization criteria to select the number of latent units (n) and B value. 

3. Latent Variable mapping Heuristic -- We perform a KL-divergence to perform a mapping between the latent variables and the sensitive features.

3. Comparison to existing technologies -- We compare our B-VAE detector with other techniques such as SVDD, VAE based reconstruction, SVDD-chain, and VAE-reconstruction-chain.
